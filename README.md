`dotfiles`
================

This repository contains my personal _dotfiles_. At the beginning they were prepared for Linux environment and were mostly inspired by [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). Then they were ported for macOS based environment with addition of some sugar from [mathiasbynens works](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). Now, finally, they are fitted for Linux environment again - mac didn't suit me well ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mgetka/dotfiles
