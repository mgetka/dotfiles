`dotfiles`
================

This repository contains my personal _dotfiles_. At the beginning they were prepared for Linux environment and were mostly inspired by [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). Now I've ported them to macOS based environment and added some sugar from [mathiasbynens works](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).
